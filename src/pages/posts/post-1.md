# Lola-Rose's First Blog Post

Published on: 05/07/2025

Hello to everyone reading this. Welcome to my first blog post! This is just a little post created for use in my upcoming blog: 
> Everything I did to make my own blog!

I thought it would be useful for you to have a live blog example (as that's what we are making after all), so here it is!

To make this post a little bit more interesting than just a first post, I'll use this as an opportunity to tell you about myself.

## About Me
### An Introduction
My name is Lola-Rose Gooch and I am a curious, motivated individual currently undergoing my Computer Science degree. 

### How it Started
I began my course in September of 2025 after years of dabbling with tech. As a child of the 2000's, I was lucky to be born at a time when tech was readily available and very quickly improving. This meant that when I got my first device (this was an iPad), I had millions of resources at my very fingertips. 

Unfortunately, my first move as a budding tech-lover was not to research the world of tech and become the world's youngest tech genius. Instead, I played games like Minecraft and Roblox. It wasn't until my fifth year of Primary School that I began to properly learn about the world of tech. 

### Beginning my Tech Journey
Year 5 was when I was taught about Scratch. This is a website that introduced algorithmic thinking to me, and taught me basic computing principles like loops. It wasn't until I started Secondary School that I realised there was much more that computing had to offer.


### Expanding my Horizons
At the beginning of my Computer Science lessons in high-school, I was taught Python. It captivated me. After every lesson, I would excitedly wait until I was home to explore deeper into what was taught. My teacher taught us variables? I taught myself basic operations I could perform on those variables. My teacher taught us for-loops? I created a simple script to read through a story I had written, one character at a time, as if it was being typed before your eyes.

Everything I learnt opened a realm of possibilities, especially when I learnt what I library was. The first library I taught myself was Tkinter, as a suggestion from my teacher. After testing it a bit, I created the customary calculator. It had all the basic numerical operations, a screen to see your inputted and outputted answers, and the option to toggle the resizeability of the screen to see a secret message (calculators do that, right?).

### Is Computer Science really what I want?
As I ventured through high-school, a subject I had been finding interesting for the past few years grew into a competitor against computer science: mathematics. 

I loved maths. There was always something so satisfying about learning new concepts and methods, and applying this knowledge to solve difficult problems. During high-school and sixth-form, I found myself entering many maths competitions: intermediate and senior maths challenges, and the Mathematical Olympiad for Girls (I was the only person from my cohort selected for this). 

So when it came to the middle of my A-Levels and I had to choose between Computer Science and Mathematics, I was conflicted. 

### Victory for Computer Science
To decide what route I was to take, I had to look into why I liked each subject. After lots of thought, I realised something important.

I loved Maths for its problem-solving, and the satisfaction gained from solving these problems. 

I loved Computer Science for the same reason, but also its creativity. 

Something I haven't mentioned so far is my love for art. My first art pieces were rearranging coins on the floor of my grandparent's house. This expanded into painting, clay, and various forms of DIY. Art was an ever-present theme in my life, and I was captivated by the ability to create something unique. I decided that Computer Science would allow me more room for this creativity.

Of course there were other reasons for choosing Computer Science, like how I found researching the subject to be more interesting than researching around Mathematics. But either way, my choice was made.

### Beginning my Degree
Now that I knew where I wanted to head, I could begin the rest of my journey. At the time of writing this blog, I have just completed the first year of my studies. I have learnt a lot.

From modules like Java programming to Website Development; Computing Principles to Databases, I have enjoyed it all. 

First-year is now over, and I have had time to reflect on my choice: I couldn't be happier, and I have so much to look forwards to.


### The Future
From custom alexa skills to my portfolio, I have so many things that I want to create. I plan to include some of them in my blog, as well as tutorials and tips made from what I learn along the way.

I hope this post has been an enjoyable read. See you next time!
